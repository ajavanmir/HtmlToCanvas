![Project Preview](preview.png)

A powerful JavaScript tool that captures HTML forms (including RTL layouts) and converts them to high-quality PNG images with all form data preserved.

## Features

- ✅ Converts HTML forms to canvas images with perfect fidelity
- ✅ Supports Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts and Persian/Arabic text
- ✅ Preserves all form values (inputs, textareas, selects) in the screenshot
- ✅ Adds dynamic content sections (like "About Me" text) to the output
- ✅ High-resolution output with configurable scaling (2x by default)
- ✅ Clean, responsive UI with Bootstrap RTL
- ✅ Simple one-click export functionality

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/html-to-canvas.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install html2canvas
   ```

3. Include the required files in your HTML:

   <script src="js/app.js"></script>
   ```

## Usage

2. Add any additional content sections (like the "About Me" textarea)
3. Click the "Submit Form" button to generate and download the screenshot

### Advanced Configuration

const options = {
  scale: 2,           // Output quality multiplier
  background: '#fff',  // Background color
  width: 800,         // Fixed width (optional)
  useCORS: true       // Enable cross-origin image capture
};
```
